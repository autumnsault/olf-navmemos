abstract = {MEMS-based oscillators are an emerging class of highly miniaturized, batch manufacturable timing devices that can rival the electrical performance of well-established quartz-based oscillators. In this review, a description is given of the key properties of a MEMS resonator that determine the overall performance of a MEMS oscillator. Piezoelectric, capacitive and active resonator transduction methods are compared and their impact on oscillator noise and power dissipation is explained. An overview is given of the performance of MEMS resonators and MEMS-based oscillators that have been demonstrated to date. Mechanisms that affect the frequency stability of the resonator, such as temperature-induced frequency drift, are explained and an overview is given of methods that have been demonstrated to improve the frequency stability. The aforementioned performance indicators of MEMS-based oscillators are benchmarked against established quartz and CMOS technologies. {\textcopyright} 2012 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

The paper emphasizes the underlying technical changes and innovations that have driven the remarkable progress, while keeping in mind the contribution of the great body of information that was already available at the beginning of the period. The paper gives a treatment of the progress of ovenized crystal frequency standards from the early vacuum tube days through implementations using transistors, LSI, and hybrid construction. The progression of TCXO developments is also covered including analog thermistor temperature compensation, digital compensation, and techniques using micro-computers, and self-sensed oscillators.},

@article{Allan1966,
abstract = {A theoretical development is presented which results in a relationship between the expectation value of the standard deviation of the frequency fluctuations for any finite number of data samples and the infinite time average value of the standard deviation, which provides an invariant measure of an important quality factor of a frequency standard. A practical and straightforward method of determining the power spectral density of the frequency fluctuations from the variance of the frequency fluctuations, the sampling time, the number of samples taken, and the dependence on system bandwidth is also developed. Additional insight is also given into some of the problems that arise from the presence of "flicker noise" (spectrum proportional to |$\omega$| -1 ) modulation of the frequency of an oscillator. The theory is applied in classifying the types of noise on the signals of frequency standards made available at NBS, Boulder Laboratories, such as: masers (both H and N 15 H 3 ), the cesium beam frequency standard employed as the U. S. Frequency Standard, and rubidium gas cells. "Flicker noise" frequency modulation was not observed on the signals of masers for sampling times ranging from 0.1 second to 4 hours. In a comparison between the NBS hydrogen maser and the NBS III cesium beam, uncorrelated random noise was observed on the frequency fluctuations for sampling times extending to 4 hours; the fractional standard deviations of the frequency fluctuations were as low as 5 parts in 10 14 .},

@article{Teles1995,
abstract = {The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has developed the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite (TDRS) System (TDRSS) for operational tracking and communications support of low Earth-orbiting satellites. TDRSS currently consists of five geosynchronous spacecraft and the White Sands Complex (WSC) at White Sands, New Mexico. The Bilateration Ranging Transponder (BRT) System (BRTS) supports range and Doppler measurements for each TDRS using standard user tracking services. These measurements are used to generate well-determined ephemerides for the TDRSs. TDRSS provides S-band and Ku-band services through the single access (SA) antennas and S-band services through the S-band multiple access (SMA) phased array. TDRSS is capable of supporting coherent range and two-way Doppler tracking as well as noncoherent one-way return-link and one-way forward-link Doppler tracking of user spacecraft. Accurate one-way return-link tracking, which can use SMA, the most available TDRSS resource, requires a stable oscillator onboard the user spacecraft as the source of frequency. Two-way and one-way return-link tracking measurements are used for ground orbit determination for navigation and precise positioning; one-way forward-link tracking is used for autonomous onboard navigation with achievable accuracies better than those of the Global Positioning System (GPS) Precise Positioning System (PPS). This overview will discuss the various tracking and navigation capabilities of TDRSS, as well as many of the operational and research applications that have been conducted for missions such as Landsat-4, Ocean Topography Experiment (TOPEX)/Poseidon (T/P), Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE), and Extreme Ultraviolet Explorer (EUVE). {\textcopyright} 1995.},

@article{Christian2020,
abstract = {It is often necessary to identify a pattern of observed craters in a single image of the lunar surface and without any prior knowledge of the camera's location. This so-called "lost-in-space" crater identification problem is common in both crater-based terrain relative navigation (TRN) and in automatic registration of scientific imagery. Past work on crater identification has largely been based on heuristic schemes, with poor performance outside of a narrowly defined operating regime (e.g., nadir pointing images, small search areas). This work provides the first mathematically rigorous treatment of the general crater identification problem. It is shown when it is (and when it is not) possible to recognize a pattern of elliptical crater rims in an image formed by perspective projection. For the cases when it is possible to recognize a pattern, descriptors are developed using invariant theory that provably capture all of the viewpoint invariant information. These descriptors may be pre-computed for known crater patterns and placed in a searchable index for fast recognition. New techniques are also developed for computing pose from crater rim observations and for evaluating crater rim correspondences. These techniques are demonstrated on both synthetic and real images.},
