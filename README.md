# Nav Memos

Navigation memos written for Open Lunar Foundation

* [Open Lunar Foundation](https://www.openlunar.org/)

## Description

In the course of my time at Open Lunar Foundation, I wrote two
technical memos to document my work. The first is more or less
finished, but the second was a work in progress at the time I left.

* Woods, J.O. 19 Nov 2019. Two-way range and range-rate observables in
  a sequential filter. OLF-GNC-2019-01, Open Lunar Foundation, San
  Francisco, CA.

* Woods, J.O. 16 Dec 2019. Navigation filter design towards a lunar
  lander. OLF-GNC-2019-02, Open Lunar Foundation, San Francisco, CA.

This repository contains the LaTeX sources for these memos, as well as
the PDFs.
