abstract = {Images of the Earth and Moon may be used to autonomously navigate a spacecraft in cislunar space. New optical navigation (OPNAV) techniques have revitalized interest in horizon-based methods. While the generation of precise OPNAV measurements is well understood, the measurement covariance can be rather cumbersome to compute in practice. This problem is addressed by developing a simple parametric covariance model that fully captures the geometry of measuring the lit horizon of an ellipsoidal. These simple models provide insight into the nature of the horizon-based OPNAV covariance that was previously obscured by long and difficult to understand equations.},

abstract = {A method has been developed for performing autonomous Lunar orbit determination based on measurements of the times at which stars set behind or rise above the Lunar limb. This system is being developed as a possible technology for use in the Lunar exploration initiative because it enables increased autonomy of operations near the Moon. The system consists of a specially modified star camera and an extended Kalman filter. The star camera keeps track of known stars in its field of view and reports the times when stars suddenly appear or disappear without crossing the edge of the field of view. These are times that the known line-of-sight vectors to the stars cross the Lunar limb, and this knowledge translates into position information. The Kalman filter uses a series of star occultation/rising times and an orbital dynamics model to estimate the spacecraft's position and velocity. An observability analysis shows that this system is strongly observable, and a truth-model simulation has demonstrated an absolute position accuracy of 70 m per axis and an absolute velocity accuracy of 0.045 m/s per axis when using a Lunar topographic map with an RMS altitude accuracy of 100 m and a Lunar gravity model with an RMS accuracy of 1x10 -5 m/s 2 .},

abstract = {The navigation on a lunar transfer trajectory is nominally achieved by measuring the range and Doppler-shift of the telemetry link between the spacecraft and the ground-station. For this reason the existence of the link is mission critical and robotic missions fail when the telemetry link is permanently lost, for example when the on-board transceiver fails. For human missions, however, there is the possibility to make use of the crew's capability of determining the orbit by observing the apparent positions of the Moon and the Earth in front of the star background. Here a method of manual orbit determination for human lunar exploration missions is presented. Optical navigation using measurements with a sextant between landmarks and background stars has been tested by the Gemini, and used by the Apollo Astronauts. In the Apollo missions, the use of optical navigation was also used to determine the attitude of the spacecraft prior to critical manoeuvres. Here we present a more simple method that can easily be performed in an operational environment and in a even more simplified version without the use of a computer: measuring the time of occultation (eclipse) of stars by the Moon or the Earth. From these measurements the crew can determine the amount of dispersion of their spacecraft's state vector from the nominal state either by using simple navigation algorithms on laptop computers or lists of epochs tabulated before the mission. The analytical sensitivity analysis shows that for example the periselenium altitude can be determined with this method to better than 1 km with a measurement 24h before the periselenium arrival if the accuracy of the measured time of occultation is equal or better than 10 s. Examples for the application of this navigation approach are presented for lunar transfer trajectories. It is proposed to demonstrate the feasibility of the method in an experiment on board the space station.},

Among these technologies is a guidance, navigation, and control (GN{\&}C) system capable of safely and precisely delivering a spacecraft, whether manned or robotic, to a predetermined landing area. This article presents a detailed study of both terrain-relative navigation using a terrain-scanning instrument and radiometric navigation using beacons in lunar orbit or on the surface of the Moon. The models for these sensors are developed along with a baseline sensor suite that includes an IMU, star-camera, altimeter, and velocimeter. Linear covariance analysis is used to rapidly perform the trade studies relevant to this problem and to provide the navigation performance data necessary to determine how each navigation method can be used to support a 100 m 3-$\sigma$ navigation requirement on landing.},

abstract = {This paper presents a new, global database of lunar impact craters, estimated to be a complete census of all craters with diameters larger than 1–2 km. The database contains over 2 million craters, making it larger in number than any previously published lunar effort by more than a factor of 10. Of those craters, 1.3 million have diameters ≥1 km, approximately 83,000 are ≥5 km, and 6,972 craters are ≥20 km. How the database was constructed along with the reliability of features is described in detail. Comparisons are made with past published databases, demonstrating good agreement for crater size and location. An ellipticity analysis is conducted, illustrating there is no dominant direction for elliptical crater orientation based on location, diameter range, or ellipticity amount, consistent with randomness for craters ≥10 km. A spatial density analysis is described, comparing the spatial density of small versus large craters, and numerous observations about the nonuniformity of the size distributions of craters across the Moon are made. The spatial density is also used in a discussion about kilometer-scale secondary impact craters and clearly shows that they dominate the crater population in some areas of the lunar surface. This paper presents just a tiny sample of the scientific investigations that could be done with this new crater database.},

abstract = {Interest in autonomous planetary precision landing missions has been increasing in the scientific and engineering community, and is likely to continue to do so for the foreseeable future. As an enabling technology in the context of lunar landing, DLR, German Aerospace Center has been developing a terrain absolute navigation system that matches craters detected in image data to globally available lunar crater maps. The proposed Crater Navigation (CNav) system is adaptive, comprising three different crater matching methods that are specifically tailored to different navigation conditions encountered during the vehicle descent, so that it may be used as a stand-alone navigation sensor that can be closely integrated with a lander guidance, navigation, and control system to enable reliable absolute navigation throughout the entire descent phase of a mission. As robustness is a vital aspect to mission success, the CNav system includes verification mechanisms that ensure high dependability of the resulting navigation solution. This robustness is verified separately for all of the three different matching techniques presented in this paper. Closed-loop performance of the matchers is demonstrated as well, both for simulated image data sets, as for navigation camera images acquired during the Chinese Chang'e-3 landing mission. Successful uninterrupted estimation of the entire Chang'e-3 kinematic vehicle state during the powered descent until a final altitude of 350 m above ground, with neither known camera calibration nor inertial measurement unit data available, showcases the potential of the CNav system.},

abstract = {It is often necessary to identify a pattern of observed craters in a single image of the lunar surface and without any prior knowledge of the camera's location. This so-called "lost-in-space" crater identification problem is common in both crater-based terrain relative navigation (TRN) and in automatic registration of scientific imagery. Past work on crater identification has largely been based on heuristic schemes, with poor performance outside of a narrowly defined operating regime (e.g., nadir pointing images, small search areas). This work provides the first mathematically rigorous treatment of the general crater identification problem. It is shown when it is (and when it is not) possible to recognize a pattern of elliptical crater rims in an image formed by perspective projection. For the cases when it is possible to recognize a pattern, descriptors are developed using invariant theory that provably capture all of the viewpoint invariant information. These descriptors may be pre-computed for known crater patterns and placed in a searchable index for fast recognition. New techniques are also developed for computing pose from crater rim observations and for evaluating crater rim correspondences. These techniques are demonstrated on both synthetic and real images.},

abstract = {Crater Detection Algorithms (CDAs) applications range from estimation of lunar/planetary surface age to autonomous landing on planets and asteroids and advanced statistical analyses. A large amount of work on CDAs has already been published. However, problems arise when evaluation results of some new CDA have to be compared with already published evaluation results. The problem is that different authors use different test-fields, different Ground-Truth (GT) catalogues, and even different methodologies for evaluation of their CDAs. Re-implementation of already published CDAs or its evaluation environment is a time-consuming and unpractical solution to this problem. In addition, implementation details are often insufficiently described in publications. As a result, there is a need in research community to develop a framework for objective evaluation of CDAs. A scientific question is how CDAs should be evaluated so that the results are easily and reliably comparable. In attempt to solve this issue we first analyzed previously published work on CDAs. In this paper, we propose a framework for solution of the problem of objective CDA evaluation. The framework includes: (1) a definition of the measure for differences between craters; (2) test-field topography based on the 1/64° MOLA data; (3) the GT catalogue wherein each of 17,582 craters is aligned with MOLA data and confirmed with catalogues by N.G. Barlow et al. and J.F. Rodionova et al.; (4) selection of methodology for training and testing; and (5) a Free-response Receiver Operating Characteristics (F-ROC) curves as a way to measure CDA performance. The handling of possible improvements of the framework in the future is additionally addressed as a part of discussion of results. Possible extensions with additional test-field subsystems based on visual images, data sets for other planets, evaluation methodologies for CDAs developed for different purposes than cataloguing of craters, are proposed as well. The goal of the proposed framework is to contribute to the research community by establishing guidelines for objective evaluation of CDAs. {\textcopyright} 2007 COSPAR.},

abstract = {The use of images for spacecraft navigation is well established. Although these images have traditionally been processed by a human analyst on Earth, a variety of recent advancements have led to an increased interest in autonomous imaged-based spacecraft navigation. This work presents a comprehensive treatment of the techniques required to navigate using the lit limb of an ellipsoidal body (usually a planet or moon) in an image. New observations are made regarding the effect of surface albedo and terrain on navigation performance. Furthermore, study of this problem led to a new subpixel edge localization algorithm using Zernike moments, which is found to outperform existing methods for accurately finding the horizon's location in an image. The new limb localization technique is discussed in detail, along with extensive comparisons with alternative approaches. Theoretical results are validated through a variety of numerical examples.},

abstract = {Precise landings on other bodies require more than just dead reckoning using an inertial measurement unit on-board the lander. If navigation of the lander with respect to a planetary surface is desired, so-called crater detection and crater-matching algorithms might be a valuable asset to find the inertial position of the vehicle using terrain relative navigation techniques. This would enable landing close to an inertially defined landing site, which could, for example, be a surface asset of a previous mission. With the desire to reduce the landing ellipse size, more precise knowledge of the inertial state of the lander is required. Based on an extensive literature review, six different algorithms were implemented to assess the performance of these. This assessment will aid the selection of crater-detection techniques for future precision landing missions. To compare the different algorithms trade-off criteria have been established. The following criteria are assessed: 1) True detection rates 2) False detection rates 3) Accuracy: as the reference maps usually have rather high resolution, inaccuracies of just a few pixels can cause large errors. 4) Run-time: the algorithm should be on-board capable. Moreover, the robustness of the algorithms was investigated. It was found that all algorithms are capable of performing the task of extracting sufficient craters for localising the landing vehicle with respect to a surface map. A method based on extracting and clustering lit pixels delivered the most promising results for the overall detections, whereas, the machine-learning based algorithms showed slightly better robustness.},

abstract = {This paper describes an efficient and easily implemented algorithmic approach to extracting an approximation to an image's dominant projected illumination direction, based on intermediary results from a segmentation-based crater detection algorithm (CDA), at a computational cost that is negligible in comparison to that of the prior stages of the CDA. Most contemporary CDAs built for spacecraft navigation use this illumination direction as a means of improving performance or even require it to function at all. Deducing the illumination vector from the image alone reduces the reliance on external information such as the accurate knowledge of the spacecraft inertial state, accurate time base and solar system ephemerides. Therefore, a method such as the one described in this paper is a prerequisite for true “Lost in Space” operation of a purely segmentation-based crater detecting and matching method for spacecraft navigation. The proposed method is verified using ray-traced lunar elevation model data, asteroid image data, and in a laboratory setting with a camera in the loop.},
